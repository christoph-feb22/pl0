# PL0

This project is an interpreter for the educational programming language PL0.

I created the compiler in a course about compiler construction at the Aalen University, using compiler construction tools bison and flex.

The interpreter is inspired by the very good tutorial about writing a compiler [http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/all/1/](http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/all/1/)
